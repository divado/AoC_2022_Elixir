# Advent of Code 2022 in Elixir

Heavily inspired by [ðŸŽ„Advent of Code 2022ðŸŽ„ | https://github.com/norrbacka/aoc2022-elixir/tree/main]

This repo and it's content are used as a learning experience for elixir.

## Usage

First log in to Advent of Code in your browser and fetch the cookie named 'session'.

Set it as en environment variable like this 'export SESSION = "VALUE"'

Then run the program using iex -S mix, and call the get method to get the answer, and the submit answer to post it to AoC website.

```elixir
    get(220101) |> submit
```

We follow the principle YYDDLL where

YY = Two last digit of the year, so for 2018 it would be 18

DD = The days number in two digits, so for 24th of december it would be 24

LL = Two digit number representing the level, meaning either 01 or 02
